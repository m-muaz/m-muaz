- Hi explorer (👋)! I am Muhammad Muaz, a first year PhD @ UT Austin CS. 
- 🎯 I am really interested in working on next generation wireless networks and sensing systems (in case you don't know what wireless sensing technology is to put it 
briefly for the past couple of years, researchers are trying to study how our environment interact with electromagnetic waves (such as RF waves, light) and extract 
information from it to build systems that can do tasks such as contactless health monitoring, motion detection and tracking etc. In addition to it, I am also interested
in the integration of ML/DL techniques with these systems.
- 🏓In my spare time, I like to play sports, paint, visit new places, etc.
- 📝 Feel free to reach out to me if you want to discuss any cool ideas via [my-email](mailto:m.muaz@utexas.edu)
